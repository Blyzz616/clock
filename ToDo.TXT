When setting up internet cameras:
you plug in the camera
then you connect to the camera's wifi with another wifi capable device
load up the web page on that wifi
select the Wi-Fi AP name
enter username
enter password and hit OK

My thinking is:
on first boot - display 
    "First boot - Acquiring Access point names"
then display
    "
    connect to access point 'ClockAP'
    open browser and load up http://setup/
    "

In that browser, there are 2 options:
1: Internetless setup
    Input time
    select clock interface
    Click "ok & reboot"
    Display "Remember to forget this AP on your wifi device"
maybe the clock reboots, and displays the time.
(might need a reset button to factory reset the clock)
2: Select the AP name for a list
    Enter username
    Enter Password
    Enter location
    Select Imperial/Metric
    Select Clock Layout
    telemetry opt-in
    Click "ok & reboot"
    Display "Reconnect your device to your wifi"
